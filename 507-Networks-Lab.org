** Course Objectives
- To learn and use network commands.
- To learn socket programming.
- To implement and analyze various network protocols.
- To learn and use simulation tools.
- To use simulation tools to analyze the performance of various network protocols

** Suggested Programming Languages
- C / C++ / Java / Python / Equivalent Compiler 30
-  Network simulator like NS2/Glomosim/OPNET/ Packet Tracer / Equivalent

** Suggestive Exercises
1. Learn to use commands like tcpdump, netstat, ifconfig, nslookup and traceroute. Capture ping and traceroute PDUs using a network protocol analyzer and examine.
2. Write a HTTP web client program to download a web page using TCP sockets.
3. Applications using TCP sockets like:
   - Echo client and echo server
   - Chat
   - File Transfer
4. Simulation of DNS using UDP sockets.
5. Write a code simulating ARP /RARP protocols.
6. Study of Network simulator (NS) and Simulation of Congestion Control Algorithms using NS.
7. Study of TCP/UDP performance using Simulation tool.
8. Simulation of Distance Vector/ Link State Routing algorithm.
9. Performance evaluation of Routing protocols using Simulation tool.
10. Simulation of error correction code (like CRC).
